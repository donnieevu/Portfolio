🛠 Step 1: Understand Business Objectives & Define KPIs
Before jumping into the data, we need to understand the end goal—who will use this dashboard and why?
✔ Who are the users?
•	Hospital Administrators & Doctors who need insights on patient readmissions and hospital efficiency.
•	Operations Teams who want to reduce costs, improve resource allocation, and lower readmissions.
✔ What questions do they need answered?
•	Which patients are most likely to be readmitted?
•	How long do patients typically stay in the hospital?
•	Which medical conditions are most associated with readmissions?
•	Does diabetes medication impact readmissions?
•	How efficient are hospitals in handling patient care?
💡 Best Practice: We define measurable KPIs that align with these questions before touching the data. This keeps our analysis focused and impactful.
📌 Selected KPIs:
1.	Readmission Rate (%) → % of patients who were readmitted.
2.	Average Length of Stay → How long patients typically stay in the hospital.
3.	Most Common Diagnoses for Readmitted Patients → Which conditions lead to higher readmissions.
4.	Impact of Diabetes Medication on Readmissions → Do diabetes patients have higher readmission rates?
5.	Hospital Workload Analysis → Average number of procedures, medications, and lab tests per patient.

🛠 Step 2: Data Exploration & Cleaning (SQL in BigQuery)
Now that we have our KPIs, we need to explore the dataset and clean the data so it’s accurate and usable.
✔ Exploring the Data
•	We run a SELECT * query to preview the data.
•	We use INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS to inspect column names & data types.
•	We check for missing values (NULL) and outliers.
✔ Data Cleaning Steps
•	Convert readmitted from 'yes'/'no' to Boolean (TRUE/FALSE) for easier analysis.
•	Standardize categorical variables (e.g., medical specialties, diagnoses).
•	Handle missing values using data imputation or removal if necessary.
•	Check for duplicate records and remove them if needed.
💡 Best Practice: Cleaning is an iterative process. We run an initial analysis, find issues, clean them, and repeat until the dataset is in great shape.

🛠 Step 3: Feature Engineering & KPI Calculations (SQL in BigQuery)
Once the dataset is clean, we transform it to make our KPIs easier to calculate.
✔ Transformations We Apply:
1.	Create a new column for Readmission Bool:
sql
CopyEdit
SELECT *,
       CASE WHEN readmitted = 'yes' THEN TRUE ELSE FALSE END AS readmitted_bool
FROM `semiotic-timer-453600-j7.healthcare_kpis.hospital_readmissions`;
➡ Why? This makes it easier to calculate readmission rates.
2.	Group data by hospital metrics (procedures, medications, and length of stay).
3.	Aggregate readmission rates by age group & diagnosis to identify patterns.
💡 Best Practice: This is where we reshape the data for visualization. We optimize queries for fast aggregations so the Tableau dashboard loads quickly.
________________________________________
🛠 Step 4: Export Data for Visualization (CSV or Direct BigQuery Connection to Tableau)
Once our KPIs are ready, we export the transformed data into Tableau.
✔ Best Options for Data Export:
1️⃣ Export as a CSV file
•	We run queries, save results as CSV, and import into Tableau.
•	Best for static analysis & small datasets.
2️⃣ Connect Tableau directly to BigQuery
•	This allows real-time updates and is best for large datasets.
•	Tableau queries BigQuery dynamically instead of relying on pre-saved CSVs.
💡 Best Practice: If we expect frequent data updates, we use a live connection to BigQuery. If data is static, we use CSV exports to avoid excessive BigQuery costs.

🛠 Step 5: Build Tableau Dashboard (Data Storytelling)
With clean and structured data in Tableau, we focus on effective data visualization.
✔ Designing a Dashboard for Impact:
•	Simple & Actionable → No unnecessary charts; focus on key insights.
•	Easy to Read → Use clear labeling & interactive filters.
•	Storytelling Approach → Guide users from problem to insight to action.
✔ Planned Visualizations:
1.	Hospital Readmission Rates (Bar Chart)
o	X-axis: Hospitals
o	Y-axis: Readmission Rate (%)
o	Why? Quickly identifies underperforming hospitals.
2.	Average Length of Stay vs. Readmission (Scatter Plot)
o	X-axis: Time in Hospital
o	Y-axis: Readmission Likelihood
o	Why? Helps see if longer hospital stays reduce readmissions.
3.	Most Common Diagnoses for Readmitted Patients (Pie Chart)
o	Why? Shows which medical conditions lead to higher readmission rates.
4.	Impact of Diabetes Medication on Readmissions (Grouped Bar Chart)
o	Groups: Patients taking vs. not taking diabetes meds
o	Why? Helps hospitals decide if diabetes management needs improvement.
5.	Hospital Workload Analysis (Heatmap)
o	X-axis: Hospitals
o	Y-axis: Average number of procedures, medications, & lab tests
o	Why? Identifies hospitals handling high patient loads.
💡 Best Practice: The dashboard should answer key business questions in under 5 seconds. Users shouldn’t have to “dig” for insights.

🔄 Project Workflow & Best Practices
1️⃣ Define KPIs → Align business goals with measurable metrics.
2️⃣ Explore & Clean Data (SQL in BigQuery) → Ensure data is accurate & structured.
3️⃣ Feature Engineering (SQL in BigQuery) → Prepare KPIs for fast analysis.
4️⃣ Export Data (CSV or Direct Connection) → Get data into Tableau efficiently.
5️⃣ Build Dashboard (Tableau) → Tell a clear, actionable data story.
💡 Why this workflow?
•	Prevents wasted effort. We plan first instead of running random SQL queries.
•	Follows best practices. We clean & structure data first, avoiding messy dashboards.
•	Optimizes performance. We aggregate KPIs in SQL so Tableau loads fast.
