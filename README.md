# Donald Vu — Portfolio (Website + Projects)

This repository powers my **portfolio website** and houses project work across two tracks:

- **Application Support / Incident Labs** (shown on the website): practical drills for triage, logging, and recovery (e.g., Nginx 502, app 500 with DB credential rotation, performance baselining).
- **Data / Ops Analytics** (in this repo): SQL/Python pipelines and dashboards that turn raw data into decision-ready insights.

**Live site:** portfolio-six-weld-82.vercel.app  
**Repo focus:** Website source under `portfolio_webpage/` and data/ops projects under `healthcare_analytics_project/` and `learning/`.  
*(Earlier repo description referenced Python/SQL/Tableau projects — those still live here alongside the website.)*
