ðŸš€ Summary: How to Think Like a Data Analyst
Step	What to Do
1. Break Down the Business Question	Identify the numerator (subset) and denominator (total population).
2. Convert to SQL Components	Use COUNT(*) for total rows and COUNTIF(condition) for subsets.
3. Apply Math Logic	Divide subset by total, then multiply by 100 for percentages.
4. Format for Readability	Use ROUND() and AS alias for clear reporting.
5. Generalize for Other KPIs	Reuse the structure for different metrics like age, medication, and hospital stays.
